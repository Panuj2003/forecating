    "# ðŸ“„ Project Write-up: Hotel Inventory Forecasting & Recommendation System\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. What is the core business problem and why does it matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "The core business problem is to **forecast the demand of bar inventory items in a hotel** and **recommend appropriate inventory (par) levels**. Accurate forecasts help maintain optimal stock levels, avoid stockouts or overstocking, and reduce waste. This directly affects customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and cost savingsâ€”making it a crucial aspect of hotel operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. What assumptions did you make? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Historical consumption patterns reflect future demand trends.\n",
    "- Data is clean and accurate (no significant missing or corrupt values).\n",
    "- External factors (seasonality, events) remain similar during prediction.\n",
    "- The inventory lead time is consistent, allowing weekly aggregation.\n",
    "\n",
    "These assumptions simplify modeling and align with real-world inventory management scenarios where past patterns often influence future needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What model did you use and why did you choose it? Why not others?\n",
    "\n",
    "We used **Simple Moving Average and Rolling Mean** techniques to forecast future demand. These models were chosen for their:\n",
    "- Interpretability and ease of deployment.\n",
    "- Suitability for short-term forecasts with seasonal trends.\n",
    "- Low data requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "More complex models (like ARIMA, XGBoost, or LSTM) could be considered if larger or more granular datasets were available, but for this projectâ€™s scope, simplicity and transparency were prioritized.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. How does your system perform? What would you improve?\n",
    "\n",
    "The system performs reasonably well for short-term demand estimation and helps in estimating weekly par levels. However:\n",
    "- It can be improved by incorporating **seasonality detection**, **holiday effects**, and **event-based adjustments**.\n",
    "- More advanced models could be explored for better accuracy.\n",
    "- Alert mechanisms can be built to flag unusual patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. How would this solution work in a real hotel?\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice:\n",
    "- Forecasts would be generated weekly using updated consumption data.\n",
    "- Inventory staff would use recommended par levels to place restocking orders.\n",
    "- Visual dashboards or reports could assist decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional: What would break at scale? What would you track in production?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scalability Issues:**\n",
    "- Manual tuning of moving averages doesnâ€™t scale across 100+ items.\n",
    "- Forecasting many SKUs may need parallelization or cloud deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Production Monitoring:**\n",
    "- Track forecast vs actual demand (error rates).\n",
    "- Monitor outlier spikes in consumption.\n",
    "- Automate retraining or model updates periodically.\n",
    "\n",
